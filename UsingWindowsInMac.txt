Virtual machine software above Mac OS:

- The following two fine but not free 
    https://www.parallels.com/  or 
    http://www.vmware.com/

- The free one with less features 
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
    
- For a new Macbook with enough disk space, see Boot Camp Assistant
    https://support.apple.com/guide/bootcamp-assistant/install-windows-on-your-newer-mac-bcmp173b3bf2/mac
 
- How to select a different startup disk:

You need to install Virtual machine, then install Windows, then install VS. 
  - You have to make sure the settings of Hardware Virtualization: Enable VT-x/AMD-V checked

If you are not a system expert, my suggestion is to simply use a PC in Windows, either desktop or laptop.
You also can make use of the CS lab where VS 2017 was installed
